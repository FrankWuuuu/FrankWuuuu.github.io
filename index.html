          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Frank Wu, a student at the University of
            Washington studying Computer Science. My hometown is Vancouver WA.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always had a love and curiosity for the natural world. With a
            Computer Science major and prospective Applied Math double major,
            I'm excited to learn how to bridge the gap between my love for
            problem-solving and my curiosity in science.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I love practicing martial arts, skating on the
            Burke-Gilman Trail, and listening to electronic music.

            <h3>Competition King</h3>
            <p>Front-end developer &emsp; <em> Present</em></p>
            <p>
              My martial arts coach was sick of using spreadsheets to host an annual wushu tornament,
              so we decided to build a website that could host
              and manage the competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the main front-end developer of the
              project, <em>Competition King</em>, I've been building the
              website using React while collaborating with UX designers and
              back-end developers. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to have our website used in the 2023 Collegiate Wushu Tornament
              and 10th Seattle International Martial Arts Championship, and eventually scale the project so that 
              it can be used to host any martial arts tornament.

              I worked on an information gathering web application to consolidate printer data for other

            <h3>TFT Web Scraper & Web App</h3>
            <p>
              Last summer, I built a web application that summarized the best strategies for the online game TeamFight Tactics (TFT). I used Selenium as a web scraper 
              to collect data from various TFT strategy blog websites, and processed the data into one summarizing TierList. Then, using Django and 
              React, I built a web application to present these findings. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was my first time learning how to use Selenium, as well as
              an opportunity to get more comfortable with React and Django.

              <p> 
                Wushu is the modernized, performance based version of Chinese Kung Fu.

                I have been practicing Wushu (Chinese martial arts) for ten years,

                While I had been speciallizing in three sectional staff (see video below!) and traditional
                fist forms, I've recently been getting into Southern style forms such as
                Nanquan (Southern Fist) and Nandao (Southern Broadsword)
